# Introduction
Materialized Views in PostgreSQL are an essential database optimization feature that helps improve query performance by storing precomputed query results. Unlike regular views, which always fetch the latest data from the underlying tables, materialized views physically store the query output, reducing execution time for expensive and complex queries.

## 1. Difference Between Views and Materialized Views

| Feature                | View                                | Materialized View                     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Data Storage**       | Does not store data, always fetches from base tables. | Stores query results physically. |
| **Performance**       | Can be slow for complex queries. | Faster for expensive queries. |
| **Data Freshness**    | Always returns up-to-date data. | Requires manual or scheduled refresh. |
| **Use Case**          | When real-time data is needed. | When performance optimization is needed. |

### Example of a Regular View
```
CREATE VIEW employee_view AS
SELECT emp_id, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees;
```
* This view fetches real-time data from the `employees` table.

### Example of a Materialized View
```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_details_mv AS
SELECT emp_id, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees;
```
* This materialized view **stores** the query result for faster access.

## 2. Creating a Materialized View

### Syntax
```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```
### Example
```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_details_mv AS
SELECT emp_id, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees;
```
* This stores employee details in a separate physical table, reducing the need for repeated expensive queries.

### Querying a Materialized View
```
SELECT * FROM employee_details_mv;
```
* This retrieves the stored data instantly.

## 3. Refreshing Materialized Views
Since materialized views store data separately, they **don't update automatically** when the underlying data changes. We need to refresh them manually or on a schedule.

### Manual Refresh
```
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_details_mv;
```
* This updates the materialized view with the latest data.

### **Refreshing with `CONCURRENTLY`**
```
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY employee_details_mv;
```
* Allows refreshing the view without locking it, so users can still query the old data while the refresh is happening.

* *Note:* To use `CONCURRENTLY`, the materialized view **must have a unique index**.

## 4. Modifying and Dropping a Materialized View

### Modifying a Materialized View
PostgreSQL **does not support direct modifications** to a materialized view. Instead, we need to **drop and recreate it**.

```
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_details_mv;
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_details_mv AS
SELECT emp_id, first_name, last_name, salary, dept_id
FROM employees;
```
* This updates the structure of the materialized view.

### Dropping a Materialized View
```
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_details_mv;
```
* Deletes the materialized view from the database.

## 5. Performance Comparison: View vs. Materialized View
To demonstrate the performance difference, let's assume we have an `employees` table with **50 million records**.

### Creating a View
```
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW employees_dept_avg_salary AS
SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary, COUNT(1) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id;
```
### Creating a Materialized View
```
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW employees_dept_avg_salary_mv AS
SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary, COUNT(1) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id;
```
### Query Execution Time
#### Querying the View:
```
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM employees_dept_avg_salary;
```
* **Slower Execution**: Since it recomputes the aggregation every time.

#### Querying the Materialized View:
```
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM employees_dept_avg_salary_mv;
```
* **Much Faster Execution**: Data is precomputed and stored, reducing query execution time.

**Conclusion:**
Materialized views significantly **boost performance** for complex queries by storing precomputed results. However, they require **manual refresh** to stay updated.

## 6. Use Cases for Materialized Views

| Use Case | Explanation |
|----------|------------|
| **Performance Optimization** | Precomputing query results improves response times for large datasets. |
| **Reporting & Dashboards** | Faster loading times for reports that don't need real-time data. |
| **Data Warehousing** | Used in data warehouses for pre-aggregated results. |
| **Historical Snapshots** | Stores snapshots of data at specific points in time. |
| **Pre-Filtered Data** | Used for user-specific or restricted access views. |

## 7. Common Mistakes to Avoid
* `Not Refreshing Regularly:` If our data changes frequently, we must **refresh the materialized view** to avoid outdated results.
* `Overusing Materialized Views:` Don't use materialized views for simple queries. They are best for **complex, resource-intensive queries**.
* `Ignoring Storage Costs:` Materialized views consume disk space, so be mindful of storage and refresh overhead.

## 8. Automating Materialized View Refresh with CRON
We can schedule materialized view refreshes using **pg_cron**.

### Installing `pg_cron` in PostgreSQL
```
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;
```
### Scheduling a Refresh Every Hour
```
SELECT cron.schedule('0 * * * *', 'REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_details_mv');
```
* This refreshes the materialized view **every hour** automatically.

## 9. Best Practices
### When to Use Materialized Views
* Large datasets with complex aggregations
* Reports and dashboards that don't need real-time updates
* Query optimization for frequently accessed datasets

### When **Not** to Use Materialized Views
* When real-time data is required
* For simple queries with minimal performance impact

## 10. Conclusion
Materialized views in PostgreSQL offer a **powerful way to optimize query performance** by storing precomputed query results. They are especially useful for **reporting, analytics, and performance tuning** but require **manual refreshes** to stay updated. By following best practices, we can effectively integrate materialized views into our PostgreSQL database for improved efficiency.
