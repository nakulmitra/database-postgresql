# ðŸ“˜ Bitmap Index Scan in PostgreSQL - Complete Theory with Real Query Plan

PostgreSQL offers multiple access methods to retrieve rows efficiently based on the query and data distribution. One such powerful and often misunderstood mechanism is the **Bitmap Index Scan**.

In this tutorial, we will explore:

* What a Bitmap Index Scan is
* How it's different from a traditional Index Scan
* When PostgreSQL uses it
* Real-world examples and query plans
* Performance insights

## What is a Bitmap Index Scan?

A **Bitmap Index Scan** is an advanced query execution strategy used by PostgreSQL when:

* Multiple **conditions** exist, each with its own index
* **Moderate number of rows** match - not too few (for Index Scan) and not too many (for Seq Scan)
* PostgreSQL wants to **reduce heap access** by batching reads

Instead of fetching each matching row individually (as with a regular Index Scan), PostgreSQL:

1. Scans the index and creates a **bitmap** of matching row locations.
2. Combines multiple bitmaps using **Bitmap AND / Bitmap OR**.
3. Fetches heap pages **in batch**, reducing random I/O and improving performance.

## Bitmap Index Scan vs Index Scan

| Feature                | Index Scan             | Bitmap Index Scan                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Access Method          | Row-by-row via index   | Bitmap of matches -> batch heap access |
| Heap Access            | Immediate              | Deferred + combined                   |
| Use Case               | Very selective filters | Moderately selective filters          |
| Multi-index support    | No                   | Yes (via Bitmap AND / Bitmap OR)    |
| Heap page optimization | No                   | Yes                                 |

## Real Query Example

Assume we have a table `employees` with **50 million** rows. We want to search for employees by `full_name` or `salary`.

```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT * FROM tutorial.employees
WHERE full_name = 'Employee_234' OR salary = 70064.00;
```

PostgreSQL uses:

* Bitmap Index Scan on `full_name`
* Bitmap Index Scan on `salary`
* Combines them with **BitmapOr**
* Then fetches rows via **Bitmap Heap Scan**

## Query Plan Breakdown

> ![Bitmap Scan Query Planner](https://github.com/nakulmitra/database-postgresql/blob/master/notes/images/BitMap_Index_Scan.png)

Here's the actual query execution plan:

```
Bitmap Heap Scan on employees
  Recheck Cond: ((full_name = 'Employee_234') OR (salary = 70064.00))
  Heap Blocks: exact=864
  Buffers: shared hit=8 read=866
  ->  BitmapOr
        Buffers: shared hit=5 read=5
        ->  Bitmap Index Scan on idx_full_name_salary
              Index Cond: (full_name = 'Employee_234')
              Buffers: shared hit=4
        ->  Bitmap Index Scan on idx_salary
              Index Cond: (salary = 70064.00)
              Buffers: shared hit=1 read=5
Planning Time: 0.144 ms
Execution Time: 35.420 ms
```

### Breakdown:

#### Step 1: Bitmap Index Scan on `full_name`

* Index: `idx_full_name_salary`
* Matching TIDs are recorded in a bitmap
* Shared buffers hit = 4 (in memory)

#### Step 2: Bitmap Index Scan on `salary`

* Index: `idx_salary`
* Another bitmap created
* Buffers read = 5 (from disk), hit = 1

#### Step 3: BitmapOr

* Both bitmaps are **merged using OR**
* Buffers: 5 pages (combined)

#### Step 4: Bitmap Heap Scan

* PostgreSQL reads heap blocks in **batch**
* Avoids repeated access to the same block
* Matches rechecked for MVCC safety
* Heap blocks touched = 864

### Performance Stats:

* **Planning Time:** 0.144 ms
* **Execution Time:** 35.420 ms
* This is significantly faster than individual row-by-row index scans for high-match conditions

## When Does PostgreSQL Use Bitmap Index Scans?

PostgreSQL automatically switches to Bitmap Index Scan when:

* Filters are **not too selective** (10-15% of table)
* **Multiple conditions** can be supported by separate indexes
* **Random I/O** can be minimized through batching
* The **cost estimate** of Bitmap Heap Scan is lower than other strategies

## Performance Insights

* Works best for **medium-selectivity** filters
* Efficient when using **multiple conditions**
* Reduces **heap page fetches** by batching
* Not ideal for very **selective** queries (use Index Scan)
* Not used for very **broad** queries (Sequential Scan is better)

## Summary

Bitmap Index Scans are a **smart hybrid mechanism** in PostgreSQL:

They combine the **precision of Index Scans** and the **efficiency of Sequential Scans** through bitmap logic and batch heap access.

### Key Advantages:

* Combines multiple indexes using `Bitmap AND` / `Bitmap OR`
* Minimizes heap fetches
* Efficient for complex filter conditions
* Great for **analytics, reporting**, and **multi-column search**
